ok Rename TypedPostfixExpressionState into TypedPostfixExpressionSearchState
ok Move PrefixExpressionState into lbcpp-ml
ok PrefixExpressionState: better computation of the action sets depending on the arity of the functions
ok New: PostfixExpressionSearchState (without typing constraints)
ok Rename ExpressionRPN related stuff
